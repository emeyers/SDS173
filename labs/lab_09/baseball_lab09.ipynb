    "In multiple linear regression we use multiple predictions $x_i$ and multiple coefficients $\\hat{\\beta_i}$ to predict a value $y_i$, i.e., we use data to find the $\\hat{\\beta_i}$ in the equation $\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\cdot x_1 + \\hat{\\beta_2} \\cdot x_2 + ... + \\hat{\\beta_k} \\cdot x_k$. Once we have \"learned\" the coefficients $\\hat{\\beta_i}$ from a dataset (usually by minimizing the RMSE) we can then use this equation to make new predictions $\\hat{y_i}$ for different $x_i$.\n",

    "In order to find a better statistic for predicting runs, we will create a model that is a linear combination of basic statistics that has the form: $\\hat{r} =  \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\cdot 1B + \\hat{\\beta_2} \\cdot 2B + ... + \\hat{\\beta_k} \\cdot HR$, where $\\hat{r}$ is the predicted number of runs a team scored in a season and $1B$, $2B$, ... $HR$ are the number of singles, doubles, ..., home runs, a team had in a season. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this using the Statsmodels package in Python, we can use the formula interface using the syntax `'y = x1 + x2 + x3'` etc. However, Statsmodels package cannot handle variable names that start with numbers. Thus, if we tried to do an equation of the form: `'R ~ 1B + 2B + 3B'` we would get an error message. To deal with this, we need to rename our variables that start with numbers to instead start with letters. \n",

Save this to a new name called `teams_162_relabel`. Note: the relabel method actually modifies the original dataset, so be careful if you run this method more than once! i.e., you might have to recreate the `teams_162` dataset if you run `tb.relabel` more than once.  \n",
