You also created a special method that enables you to print the state of a baseball game using the `print()` function. However, it can be easier to understand, and more aesthetically pleasing, to see a visualizations of the state of a baseball game rather than just printing out the state. Let's now add a method to our `Baseball_Game` object that create a visualiziation of the state of the game using Matplotlib's graphics. \n",

To do this problem, please start with the file `baseball_game_with_graphics.py` which has a partial implementation of this method (i.e., it has a number of graphical elements that will be useful when constructing your solution). Your display of the state of the game should have the following properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It should display a baseball diamond with red dots indicating whether a running is on a particular base.\n",
    "2. It should display the number of balls, strikes and outs.\n",
    "3. It should display the inning and the score.\n",
    "4. It should have an optional argument, `batter_name`, for the name of the current batter (e.g., the default is set to the empty string)\n",
    "5. It should have an optional argument `center_string`, for a string displayed in the middle of the baseball diamond.\n",

As you will hopefully recall from previous labs, the retrosheet field `EVENT_CD` lists the outcome of what happened in a plate appearance based on a code that goes from 0 to 24.

I have given you these grouping names in an numpy array called `event_group_names` in the code chunk below. \n",

If it is the top of the inning, then you should get the current spinner for the away team and then increase the `away_batter_num` by 1. If the `away_batter_num` is greater than 8, it should be reset to 0 (Hint: using the modulus operator, %, could be useful here).
