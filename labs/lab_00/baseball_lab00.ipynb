The purpose of the labs is to give you hands-on experience using the skills from the main YData course (S&DS 123/523) while working within a particular domain.  For this seminar, the focus is on analyzing baseball data!\n",

It is recommended that you work on the Y123 practice exercises each week, and especially the rest of Practice 01.  \n",
